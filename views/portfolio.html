    <p>While creating this website I used XAMPP as a localhost. I started off with HTML5 Boilerplate and added in the AngularJS module to be able to reduce the code necessary for the website.
  I also added stylesheets for FontAwesome as I like their icons for social media links in the footer.
  I'm also using bootstrap to help the website be displayed on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>Before creating this website I hadn't used AngularJs, but I followed the tutorials on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and I have an understanding of the basics.</p>
  <p>In my previous job I had used Freemark Template Language, which wasn't as nice as AngularJS as it had blocks of code in *.ftl files which were difficult to read.
    It would call a html file and populate it with JSON from the database. It was similar to AngularJS in that respect. It couldn't format the date, so I had to create my own function in order to change a timestamp into the correct format.</p>
  <p>I've been reading various articles about website design, such as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/workflow-design-develop-modern-portfolio-website/" target="_blank">this article</a> by Adham Dannaway. I also followed a few of his suggestions such as using Modernizr and logical breakpoints.</p>
  <p>I had previously come across responsive design and flexible grids in my work, but found the article useful. I'm aware of borrowing too much from other sources, as someone's usually already done it. So why reinvent the wheel?</p>
  <p>In my last job I was updating the front end of a website used to interact with a system that could check various sources for specific keywords and phrases using Rules. Rules would match on certain pages and generate a notification.</p>
  <p>There were several projects I worked on for this system, such as a Rule creation form which would allow the user to choose options and layout a rule that could be used by the system.</p>
  <p>Another project was a search page, which would limit the options available to the user based on the choices they made.</p>
