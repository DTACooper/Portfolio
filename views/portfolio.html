    <p>While creating this website I used XAMPP as a localhost. I started off with HTML5 Boilerplate and added in the AngularJS module to be able to reduce the code necessary for the website.
  I also added stylesheets for FontAwesome as I like their icons for social media links in the footer.
  I'm also using bootstrap to help the website be displayed on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>Before creating this website I hadn't used AngularJs, but I followed the tutorials on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and I have an understanding of the basics.</p>
  <p>In my previous job I had used Freemark Template Language, which wasn't as nice as AngularJS as it had blocks of code in *.ftl files which were difficult to read.
    It would call a html file and populate it with JSON from the database. It was similar to AngularJS in that respect. It couldn't format the date, so I had to create my own function in order to change a timestamp into the correct format.</p>
  <p>I borrowed a jQuery function to transition a page from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/workflow-design-develop-modern-portfolio-website/" target="_blank">this article</a> by Adham Dannaway. I also followed a few of his suggestions such as using Modernizr and logical breakpoints.</p>
  <p>I had previously come across responsive design and flexible grids in my work, but found the article useful.</p>
  <p>The website was pretty straight forward, but the section I had most difficulty with was the Contact form. I could do the layout but I tried various methods with various degrees of success. I changed it to AngularJS as I was already using it and it doesn't currently throw errors but it doesn't manage to send an email.</p>
