  <p>I first started learning HTML and CSS around the time I was at college and had a go at a website. I didn't start really getting into it until I was at University. I learnt C in my first year as an introduction to programming, then second year I had a module called Scripting and Searching. This covered basic problem solving and the course covered Javascript in 4 weeks, PHP in about 4 weeks and Perl in 2 weeks. I seem to remember there being a test in the second week however and then we had coursework over Christmas. I quite enjoyed scripting in Perl though and did the coursework in Perl.</p>
  <p>After University I joined a company called Cybyl as a SOC Analyst and when Cybyl became Centient, the new CTO and CEO were looking for a front end developer. I offered my services after proving I could script. The old system was written in Python and Django, which I learnt in case I'd need to update the old system. It was ultimately done away with however and a new system was created which was faster and did things differently but was able to generate notifications when key phrases matched.</p>
  <p>An external company was initially brought in to build the front end, then I took over and learnt some new technologies. The website used Freemark Template Language which wasn't as nice as AngularJS as it had blocks of code in *.ftl files which were difficult to read.
    It would call a html file and populate it with JSON from the database. It was similar to AngularJS in that respect. It couldn't format the date, so I had to use a seperate function in order to change a timestamp into the correct format.</p>
  <p>The front end of the website was used to interact with a system that could check various sources for specific keywords and phrases using Rules. Rules would match on certain pages and generate a notification. There were several projects I worked on for this system, such as a Rule creation form which would allow the user to choose options and layout a rule that could be used by the system. Another project was a search page, which would limit the options available to the user based on the choices they made.</p>
  <p>Centient was shut down and all the code was sold off with the company, so I don't have access to it. I have created this website in order to showcase what I can do. Or I might move back into a Security Analyst role and start making the website secure.</p>
  <p>Before creating this website I hadn't used AngularJs, but I followed the tutorials on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and I have an understanding of the basics. I've been reading various articles about website design, such as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/workflow-design-develop-modern-portfolio-website/" target="_blank">this article</a> by Adham Dannaway. I also followed a few of his suggestions such as using Modernizr and logical breakpoints. I had previously come across responsive design and flexible grids in my work, but found the article useful.</p>
  <p>While creating this website I used XAMPP as a localhost to test it out. I started off with HTML5 Boilerplate and added in the AngularJS module to be able to reduce the code necessary for the website. I also added stylesheets for FontAwesome as I had used them before. Their icons are good for social media links, which are in the footer. I'm also using bootstrap to help the website be displayed on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>I'm currently looking for a project to do, that would be useful. I'm not vastly experienced in software engineering, I've had more experience of bolting things together that other people have made but I'm looking into improving myself and see where that leads.</p>
